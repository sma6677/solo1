    <h1>Program Description</h1>
    <p>
        The Enterprise Technology Integration major (ETI) in the College of Information Sciences and Technology is a Bachelor of Science degree program that educates students in the fundamental concepts and state-of-the-art skills in three essential areas: information technology (IT), business concepts, and "soft skills" such as working in teams. The ETI major focuses on the technology implementation perspective of enterprise system integration. The learning outcomes focus on:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Information systems interconnectedness, data interchange, process modeling and reengineering, and distributed computing environments.</li>
        <li>Business knowledge in accounting, supply chains, and more.</li>
        <li>Teaming, leadership, and other "soft skills."</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Students graduating with a degree in ETI are prepared for successful careers across industries and government in systems integration and development, as well as IT and business consulting.
    </p>

    <p>
        The ETI major is interdisciplinary, combining foundational coursework in information technology, application development, and business with specialized courses in systems integration. The major draws on courses including introductory programming, databases, networks, organizational theory, project management, and enterprise integration. In the ETI major, we add courses in emerging information technologies used to integrate information systems from an underlying back-end technology needed to accomplish system integration.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Enterprise Technology Integration?</h2>
    <p>
        Enterprise technology integration (ETI) explores how information technology resources and data are linked together within and across companies and organizations. Integrating information technology solutions in an enterprise is essential for businesses in conducting day-to-day activities as well as moving organizations forward as new business strategies emerge. Enterprises that can readily unify applications, services, information systems, and databases through information technology integration experience a competitive advantage. As an ETI major, you will gain knowledge and skills in analyzing the technology-related needs of an organization, formulating and implementing technology-based solutions, and evaluating the outcomes.
    </p>
